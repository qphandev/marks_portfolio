                <p>I have worked in 2 group projects that developed 2 webapps. Both of them include developing a front page UI and a background server. The first webapp utilizes a local server that was running in my personal computer. The second webapp uses a cloud based server that was bundled with a registered domain. I also worked in 2 other Android projects. The first project was building a task manager app that manage users’ data through a cloud based server. The second project was a graphical application that utilizes any Android device as a display for an EKG machine that my team designed for our senior project before graduation.  </p>

                    <p>Even though coating paints takes place at the final step of refinishing work, the responsibility of a painter is crucial in the successful of the job. The painter must constantly inspect the bodywork before deciding on whether it is ready for coating. It takes a lot of experience to become a painter. It usually takes many years for other people to become painters. It took me 1 year. I was the youngest painter in this company during the time that I worked there. Through this job, I learned to be responsible and work with other people as a team. This was my first fulltime job right after I graduated from high school.</p>
